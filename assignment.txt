BROKEN SHOPPER APP 1
Fix the Broken App:
-- Currently the app should be able to login, logout, go to the profile page when logged in, go to the update-profile page when logged in, update the profile, update the password. You should be able to click on the name in the nav bar to go to the profile.
Places NOT to look:
logout route
req.flash
-- If you clone remove the remote. Probably better to fork the repo
--In the readme: note each error that you corrected
Have a great 4th!
